Determining the location of the ModelSim executable...

Using: /home/pedro/intelFPGA_lite/17.0/modelsim_ase/linuxaloem

To specify a ModelSim executable directory, select: Tools -> Options -> EDA Tool Options
Note: if both ModelSim-Altera and ModelSim executables are available, ModelSim-Altera will be used.
